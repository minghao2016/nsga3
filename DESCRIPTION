Title: An Implementation of Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III for Feature Selection
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Artem Shramko

Description: This package provides an adaptation of NSGA III for multi objective 
    feature selection tasks. NSGA III is a genetic algorithm that solves multiple 
    optimisation problems simultaneously by applying a non-dominated sorting 
    technique. It uses a reference points based selection operator to explore 
    solution space and preserve diversity. See the original paper by K. Deb and 
    H. Jain (2013) for a detailed description.
